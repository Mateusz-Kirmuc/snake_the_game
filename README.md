## How to play
The game is about controlling the snake in such a way as to collect emerging
items at the same time avoiding contact with the borders of the board and the
body of the snake itself.

So far, the game has only one level of difficulty. Increasing the size of the
board does not increase the level of difficulty, but only the size of the board
 cells.
